Ansible can be installed in contol node is enough.
It uses ssh,exec and similar commands to connect to their env and run the scripts there.

-m = module [copy module]
-a = arguments

Idempotence --> Same output, regardless of input and reruns.

ansible = ad hoc command

Scripting ad-hoc i.e., making script of various adhoc commands is not good practice.
For this, we have playbooks

playbook.yml  --> YAML format

hosts: localhost
tasks:
 - copy: src="master.config" dest="~/.gitconfig" 

OR

hosts: localhost
tasks:
 - copy: 
     src: "master.config" 
     dest: "~/.gitconfig" 

To run playbooks,
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
